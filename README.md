# PathfinderDMHelper
I often found while running Pathfinder (or really any meaty tabletop rpg) that there are a lot of little things the Dungeon Master has to keep track of.  Things like secret stat rolls, evenly distributing magic items, random npc names, and much more.  Currently I use a mix of dice, a pad of paper, multiple google docs, and various websites.  This leads to a lot of extra hassle and breaks up the flow of the game.  The goal of this project is to provide a consolidated tool to handle the random tasks I and other Dungeon Master's run into when running a campaign.
## 1.0 Planned Functionality
- magic item tracker
- secret roll manager
- npc name list
