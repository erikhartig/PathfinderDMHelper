# PathfinderDMHelper
I often found while running Pathfinder (or really any meaty tabletop rpg) that there are a lot of little things the Dungeon Master has to keep track of.  Things like secret stat rolls, evenly distributing magic items, random npc names, and much more.  Currently I use a mix of dice, a pad of paper, multiple google docs, and various websites.  This leads to a lot of extra hassle and breaks up the flow of the game.  The goal of this project is to provide a consolidated tool to handle the random tasks I and other Dungeon Master's run into when running a campaign.  Currently this is specifically being developed for Pathfinder 2e but it may support other tabletop RPG's in the future.
